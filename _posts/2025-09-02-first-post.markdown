Welcome to my website! My name is Yash Bansal, and I'm a software engineer. I currently work at Forcepoint LLC, and I've been working there for around 2 years. 

This website is for multiple things. First, I want to provide updates to what I'm working on from a personal project perspective. I don't have a place to provide my thoughts on what I'm working on, and thought it would be cool to have a mini journal to record my thoughts. Secondly, I would like to keep an updated resume on the site, just so that I have a digital version if potential interviewers or opportunities arise in the future.

I don't want to only relegate this website to programming/CS related topics, so I will add a miscillaneous section as well.

Thanks for visiting, and do not hesitate to reach out to me. My socials are listed at the bottom of the page.
